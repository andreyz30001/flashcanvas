#summary How to use FlashCanvas in your web page

= Installation =

== Include _flashcanvas.js_ ==

FlashCanvas library consists of two files, _flashcanvas.js_ and _flashcanvas.swf_.
To install FlashCanvas, copy these files into some directory on a Web server,
and then add the following line to your HTML file.

{{{
<!--[if IE]><script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/flashcanvas.js"></script><![endif]-->
}}}


== Initialize Canvas elements ==

When _flashcanvas.js_ is loaded,
it automatically initialize canvas elements in the HTML file.
If you create a canvas element dynamically, on the other hand,
you need to manually initialize the element by calling FlashCanvas.initElement() method.
Here is a sample code that should work cross-browser.

{{{
var canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
document.getElementById("target").appendChild(canvas);
if (typeof FlashCanvas != "undefined") {
  FlashCanvas.initElement(canvas);
}
}}}
