#summary How to use FlashCanvas in your web page

= Installation =

== Include _flashcanvas.js_ ==

FlashCanvas library consists of two files, _flashcanvas.js_ and _flashcanvas.swf_.
To install FlashCanvas, copy these files into some directory on a Web server,
and then add the following HTML code between `<head>` and `</head>` tags on your web page.

{{{
<!--[if IE]>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/flashcanvas.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
}}}


== Initialize Canvas elements ==

When _flashcanvas.js_ is loaded, it automatically initializes canvas elements in the HTML document.
But in the following cases, you need to manually initialize the element by calling FlashCanvas.initElement() method.

  * If you create a canvas element dynamically using document.createElement("canvas").
  * If you use a canvas element before window.onload event is fired.

To make the code cross-browser, you should also check the existence of FlashCanvas object.
Here is a sample code:

{{{
var canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
document.getElementById("target").appendChild(canvas);
if (typeof FlashCanvas != "undefined") {
    FlashCanvas.initElement(canvas);
}
}}}
